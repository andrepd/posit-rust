//! This module and its submodules contain a software implementation of a standard-compliant Posit
//! floating point type, with arbitrary width and exponent width (up to 128).
//!
//! This module is **EXTENSIVELY** documented! If you want to learn more about Posits and an
//! optimised software implementation thereof (or about floating point implementations in
//! general!), you might profit from reading carefully through the code :) We assume basic
//! familiarity with both the Posit format and with two's complement integer arithmetic;
//! everything else we try to explain.
//!
//! If you know nothing about Posits and want to learn more, a good place to start is
//! <https://posithub.org/docs/Posits4.pdf>. The most up to date standard is at
//! <https://posithub.org/docs/posit_standard-2.pdf>.
//!
//! Some notation used in the comments:
//!
//!   - **Leftmost bits/msb**: most-significant bits.
//!   - **Rightmost bits/lsb**: least-significant bits.
//!   - **Bit 0, bit 1, .. bit N-1**: numbered least significant to most significant, starts at 0.

/// A Posit floating point number with `N` bits and `ES` exponent bits, using `Int` as its

/// ```
/// # use soft_posit::Posit;
/// type Foo = Posit::<32, 2, i32>;  // A 32-bit posit with 2-bit exponent field, represented in a
///                                  // 32-bit machine type
/// type Bar = Posit::<6, 1, i8>;  // A 6-bit posit with 1-bit exponent field, represented in an
///                                // 8-bit machine type.

/// Extracting these fields from a posit, and converting back to a posit with correct rounding, can
